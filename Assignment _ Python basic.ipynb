What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","- Python is a general purpose programming language. It is populor because of various reasons: Open source and free, Large community support, Easy to learn, Efficient and multi-platform support, Huge collection of Library.\n","\n","2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","- Interpreter is program that reads and execute the python code each line. It coverts Python programming language to computer undestable language.\n","\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","- Pre-defined keywords are special reserved words that have special meaning in the Python.\n","- There are total 35 pre-defined keywords: False,True, None, And,class, break,continue, if, elif, else, for, while, is, not, or, e.t.c.\n","\n"," And we can find the keyword using this command:\n","> import keyword || keyword.kwlist\n","\n","\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","- No, keywords can't be used as a variable name because keywords are reserve words in Python and have their own special menaing and features.\n","\n","5. What is mutability in Python?\n","- Mutability in Python means that we can change the value after creating.\n","\n","\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","- List are designed for collection of item and it can change so it mutable. But, Tuple are designed for fix collection of item and it can not be change after creating so it is called immutable.\n","\n","7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","-\n","\n","8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","- Logical operator in Python is a keyword use to conbine 2 or more boolean expression.\n","\n","9. What is type casting in Python?\n","- Changing the value of data from one data type to another data type is called type casting.\n","But also we can't convert string to ineger or float.\n","- Ex. for changing int to float we can write, float().\n","\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","- Implicit means that happened automatically or we can say it is a automatic behaviour by Python.\n","- Explicit means converting data type using inbuild function by ourself or user.\n","\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","- The purpose of conditional statment is to make descision in our code based on our conditions whether its True or False.\n","\n","12. How does the elif statement work?\n","- Basically elif is a combination of if and else. In some scenario we need more than 2-3 conditions to check the code.\n","> First if condition will be check, if \"if\" condition is True elif will be skipped. If \"if\" condition is False then elif condition will run and execute.\n","  >  Also if elif condition is true then next further code will be skipped but if elif condition is false then further code will execute.\n","- So we use elif to check the condition which is written under elif and print the result.\n","- Ex.- Based on if-elif-else condition\n","\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","- The major difference are:-\n","> In For loops->It will repeats the code for a specific number of times. It is best for fixed repetation.\n","\n"," >In while loop- It will repeats the code until the condition got false. It is best for unknown repetation.\n","\n","\n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","- We can take example of password authentication as we don't know after how many attempts the user will enter correct password.\n","> While loop will continue asking untill the user input the correct password.\n"," > Please find the example below.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ZyuqWwTxU_lO"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"dGvsmxVQU6YJ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Example of Q.14  > Here is one example:\n"," correct_password = \"Aaryan@123\"\n","entered_password = input(\"Enter your password:\") #(suppose the user is entering \"Rohit@123\")\n","\n","while entered_password != correct_password:\n","    entered_password = input(\"Entered Wrong password, Please enter your password again: \")#(if the password will be wrong it will show, wrong password untill you will enter the correct one)\n","\n","print(\"Access granted!\")"],"metadata":{"id":"S0IniSrpUx8k"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"8NB73MNE4nK8"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","# **Practical Questions**:"],"metadata":{"id":"s3XqCkIJH3YU"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"0SDQxMr6HipB"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"mHbEoztkG1j2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1751744673199,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Aaryan Raj","userId":"08500990427588610864"}},"outputId":"05e453ae-fdee-4df5-ae0c-f2bd4c9cd36e"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hello, World!\n"]}],"source":["#1.
